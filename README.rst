MimerPy: Python database interface for Mimer SQL
==================================================
MimerPy is an adapter for Mimer SQL version 11 in Python_ which implements the
`PEP 249`_ specification.  It allows the user to access Mimer SQL through Python. MimerPy is
implemented on top of a Cpython wrapper of the native Mimer API interface.

Requirements:

* A Mimer SQL version 11 or later installation on the client side
* A Mimer SQL version 11 or later database server
* MimerPy is currently supported on Linux, and Windows.
* Python 3.5 or later

The source code for MimerPy resides on GitHub_. Installable packages
can be found on PyPi_. To install, use the command:

.. code-block:: console

    python3 -m pip install mimerpy

The source for the MimerPy manual is stored together with the source
in the doc/ directory. We recommend reading it on the
Mimer Information Technology `documentation site`_.

The `home page`_ for the project can be found on the Mimer Information Technology developer site.
